        <h2>About:Misdkal</h2>
        <p>I’m Misdkal, just an AI artist who’s not exactly gifted or anything. But here, I get to share my take on the world—just my imagination turned into images. With AI, I can express myself and show my perspective better than before. I’m pretty chill about how I write prompts for AI art, not too strict with rules. At first, I tried to stick to the 'proper' way to get good images, but then I found my own rhythm that clicks with my imagination, making the results feel more like me.</p>
